		<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
		<div class="service-box">
			<h3>Executive Coaching</h3>
			<p>
				All successful leaders know they can benefit from outside insight. You can build success faster and sustain it longer when you have outside expertise. That is why top executives and executive on the move often work with an executive coach. The right coach brings leadership knowledge and experience, provides fresh insight and expands your thinking, builds your confidence and skills, ensures you complete your goals, and models excellence. The CURRY GROUP strives to bring that executive coaching model to you.

			<h3>Exceptional Sales Training</h3>
			<p>
				The ultra-high exceptional sales performer blows away 80% of the average sales performer. Technology has disrupted the traditional sales process by giving buyers unprecedented access to product and industry information, more control over the sales process, and more choices of products and vendors. To differentiate yourself from competitors and hold the short-lived attention span of distracted buyers, you need to be a master. The Exceptional Sales Program will bring you full circle. It will sharpen the saw, and grow you in a fast paced knowledge based platform. The tools given will be in real time, immediately usable, and impactful.

			<h2>THE CURRY PHILOSOPHY</h2>
			<p>
				Successful leaders know that they can benefit from outside insight. You can build success faster and sustain it longer when you have outside expertise. That is why I have chosen to concentrate my area of expertise in executive coaching. 
				A great executive coach can see what you cannot see. They are on the outside looking in. As your coach I will observe, ask questions, and gathers facts; and solutions will begin to emerge. I will help you clearly see your options and the decisions you can make to advance your life, leadership, and the organization you lead. The right coach brings leadership knowledge and experience, provides fresh insight and expands your thinking, builds your confidence and skills, ensures you complete your goals, and models excellence. I strive to be that executive coach.
